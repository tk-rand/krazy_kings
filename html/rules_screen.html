        <h4>Krazy Kings is a simple card game with lots of depth and strategic decisions. </h4>
        <div class="rules">
            <span>There are just a few rules you need to know before getting started.</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Game Setup:
                    The game will start with 2 special Krazy Kings decks shuffled together and each player dealt 3 cards.
                    In the middle of the play area will be the deck and discard piles, with the actions a player can take located
                    at the bottom of the screen.
                    A Krazy King deck consists of 5 suits, the standard 4 plus Stars, there are also 3 jokers in each deck which are always wild.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal of each round is to be the first one to lay down all your cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first round each player starts with 3 cards and each subsequent round you are dealt 1 extra card.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There are 11 rounds in total so in your final hand you'll have a whooping 13 cards to manage!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wilds: As stated above jokers are always wild, however there are other wilds in the game and these change each round.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    These correspond to how many cards are in your hand. So in round 1 you have 3 cards in your hand and 3's are wild. Round 2
                    you have 4 cards in your hand and 4's are wild and so on until round 11 when you have 13 cards in your hand and kings are wild!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The only way to lay down your cards is to fit them into Sets or Runs. Both of which have a 3 card minimum.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A Set consists of a minimum of any 3 cards that have the same Value. It doesn't matter if they're suite
                            (the shape on the card, i.e. hearts, starts, clubs) doesn't match all that matters is the number on the card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A Run also consists of a minimum of 3 cards, however in a Run suite does matter. In a run you need 3 cards
                            with consecutive Values in the same suite. An example from the first round: 5 hearts, 6 hearts, and 7 hearts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each turn you take during a round you will preform 3 actions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You will draw a card from either the deck or the discard pile.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Analyze your cards and decide what to discard.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally after you discard you will either end your turn OR if you can lay down your hand.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The end of a round happens when a player has laid down their hand and all the other players have had 1 more turn.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            These turns are normal except that during this turn players are allowed to lay down partial hands.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scoring: At the end of the round any cards left in a players hand have their value added up and this sum is added to their total.
                    The player with the lowest score wins. Example: in round 3 I have 5 cards in my hand I am able to lay down 3 of them in a set but am left
                    with a Queen and a Jack left in my hand these would add up to 23 (12 for the queen 11 for the jack) and this sum would be added to my total.
